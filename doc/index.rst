The Timeseries Refinery
==============================================

The Timeseries Refinery is a tool that :

- Store **versioned timeseries data** (time travel capacity), provide fine-tuned backtesting capacity, ease data monitoring
- **Centralize** data from various sources: internal data silos - external APIs Data queries on the fly or scraped on schedule
- **Automate** data processes (ETL, predictions, computations, sanity checks, â€¦)
- **Aggregate** and **transform** timeseries with formulas
- Build a common **catalog** -> shared (high level, cured) data referential
